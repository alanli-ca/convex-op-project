**graph_generator.ipynb** contains the code to generate Watts-Strogatz graphs using the Python library NetworkX. The generated graphs are saved in the data/ folder.

**graph-classification-node-degree-SVM.ipynb** contains the code to read graphs from the data/ folder and run a SVM classifier using the node-degree of each graph as the input feature.

**graph-classification-WL-kernel-SVM.ipynb** contains the code to read graphs from the data/ folder and run a SVM classifier using the state-of-the-art Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel method.
